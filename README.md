# Deck_Creator(Autogen)

## Overview

This project involves the utilization of AutoGen to create a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) system. The system comprises vector-embedded Large Language Models trained on Customer Support, Product, and Dev datasets. These LLMs play a crucial role in generating content for demo decks related to the Software as a Service (SaaS) product. 

The Dataset provided for training here is the Saas Company's confidential documentation.
Additionally, a function calling feature has been integrated into the Dev LLM.

## Features
